      <h3>Model Selection</h3>
      <p>Ped Models have taken the place <strong>temporarily</strong> of
        custom player models (the multiplayer model you are all used to). This is solely
        for making time
        to develop the necessary scripts, such as robberies and fishing, as I am
        the only developer on this project.
      </p>
      <p>
        The multiplayer model (MP Model) <strong>WILL</strong> become available once all the scripts
        to make the game functioning and playable are finished.
      </p>
      <p>Once the MP Model is available you will be prompted one time to customize your model
      when you've logged in.</p>
      <p>Have fun!</p>

      <p>Oh, one last note... For now, you can change your skin anytime you are
        innocent, by typing <strong>/reskin</strong>. Also, the arrow keys work
        for this menu, so you don't have to keep clicking. Hit SPACEBAR when done.

          <h3>What is Cops and Robbers (CNR)?</h3>
          <p>CNR is a gamemode that turns the childhood game we all love
          into a virtual depiction where you flee from the cops! There's <strong>no requirement</strong> to
          be either - You can just join the game, play in our events, drive vehicles, or complete missions
          and avoid the cops altogether if you wish.
          </p>
          <h3>So this is a Deathmatch Server?</h3>
          <p>No.
          It is <strong>not allowed</strong> for anyone to just randomly kill another player. It's
          encouraged to try to escape police without resorting to murder, however,
          deathmatch between a Cop and a Wanted is generally tolerated.
          </p>
          <h3>I'm a first time player, how do I start?</h3>
          <p>Simply click 'PLAY', and you'll be taken to the one-time character designer. From then on, you'll
          simply reconnect where ever you last logged off the next time you click 'PLAY'. Your info is
          saved based on your Steam ID, so you can play from anywhere you can access your Steam Account.
          </p>
          <h3>How do I become a Cop?</h3>
          <p>Simply visit any police department in the active area of the map to go on duty at any time.
          More duty privileges will come as you gain levels in Law Enforcement.
          </p>
          <h3>How do I lose my wanted level?</h3>
          <p>Short of giving yourself up to police, you lose wanted points every minute that
          you're not actively being chased by police.
          Once your Wanted Points are 0, you are Unwanted. If you're actively being chased, you will not
          lose Wanted Points. Lose the cops to start losing Wanted Points.
