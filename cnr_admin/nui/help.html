      <h3>Gamemode Information</h3>
      <p>
        5MCNR is a game of, well, cops and robbers. The whole point is to 
        chase/become wanted, or stay innocent, and earn as much money as possible
        to fund your addictions. Buy cars, a house, an apartment, a business,
        weapon upgrades, vehicle upgrades, and other things like drugs and women (or men?).
      </p>
      <p>
        To get started, check out our job help menus (on the left), the controls, or the
        commands section. Your life in the server is what you make it - There's no historical
        data here. Become a cop at any time, become a criminal at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, don't die without health insurance
        (purchasable at the pink and white circle at any hospital).
        You'll lose all your money, weapons, owned vehicles, and everything.
        Yes, you'll lose your house and everything that was in it, too.
        So don't die without health insurance. Ahhh... America.

      <h3>Game Controls</h3>
      <p>We try to keep the controls to a minimum, so that you can just jump in and start playing.
        With that being said, some things just can't be done without controls (obviously).
        If you don't find a control here, we probably forgot to put it here. Remind us to do that.
      </p>
      <p>Oh yeah, all controls listed are <strong>default keys</strong>. If you reassigned your
      keys for whatever reason you thought was necessary for that roleplay server you just came from,
      then you gotta figure it out on your own.
      <font class="cmd-cop">This color means it's a cop-only control.</font>
      <font class="cmd-any">This color means it's a control anyone can use.</font>
      <font class="cmd-rob">This color means it's a criminal control'.</font>
      Sorry not sorry if you're colorblind.
